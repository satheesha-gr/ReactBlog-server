      title: "Salmon Tacos with Mango Corn Salsa",
      Overview:"Super easy salmon tacos loaded with a mango, sweet corn, and cucumber salsa!",
      description: "These tacos are THE dinner for me right now! \n\n A few nights ago, I made them (again), and I set the sheet pan of salmon down on the table and my whole family literally descended upon it and started grabbing at the salmon with their hands and forks as I stood by watching in half shock, half pride. It was a feeding frenzy. \n\n Of course, we love salmon. It’s a great source of nutrition and protein and, when cooked well, it gently slides apart into buttery, juicy, delightful little flakes.\n\n But I’m not going to lie to you: the main event here is that mango corn salsa. \n\n The salmon itself is completely SOS (taco seasoning and THAT’S IT), which is why I think it makes sense to put all your effort and energy into the salsa. This salsa is also the thing that’s going to keep you sitting at the table long after you’re done eating tacos, just scooping some extra salsa bites all on its own and suddenly thinking of it as more of a salad? It can be a salad, right? I would totally eat this salsa on its own as a salad. \n\n Each bite is extra crispy and unexpected from the raw sweet corn and cucumber with a little burst of juicy flavor. But it’s also mainstream enough with the mango that my two young kids are usually happy to devour it right along with us. \n\n I love a million sauces on my tacos (okay, fine, on every recipe). But with this one, all it needs is a bit of extra lime and honey to finish it off. Simple, minimal effort, max deliciousness."

      title: "Chili Garlic Pappardelle with Smashed Broccoli and Soft Eggs",
      Overview:"Slippery, spicy, bossy noodles with a minimal-ingredient sauce, topped with a pile of roasty smashed broccoli and a perfectly messy soft egg. Yes, please.",
      description: "Oh man, these slippery, spicy noodles are a TREAT. Silky, rich, full of deep flavor and a flash of heat! \n\n I would say this recipe belongs less in the “normal family dinner” category and more in the “hangry / hardcore craving / last minute meal” category.\n\nThe big flavors end up being a bit much for my kids, so I make this for a need-it-right-now hungry mom moment that calls for something ultra-satisfying, silky, and spicy. I often end up eating it right over the stove in a moment of pure and absolute joy. \n\nAnd luckily, the components can work for everybody (buttered noodles is always a kid win, plus eggs and broccoli!), so it can be easily worked into something family-friendly or meal-prep friendly if you batch some extra broccoli and eggs to throw into other meals throughout the week. SOS at its finest. \n\n The miso just does something magical to this whole thing – if you don’t have it I think you’ll still end up just fine. But if you have it (hopefully I already convinced you to buy some with the Miso Crunch Salad!) it will elevate the flavor and add a depth that’s just really amazing for such a fast and easy recipe."

      Overview:"Amazingly creamy, saucy chickpea curry served over rice with a dollop of chili crisp and a side of cucumber salad. Ready in 20 minutes!",
      description: "This chickpea curry is, well, it’s everything. It’s cozy, it’s pantry-friendly, and maybe even a little elegant? *hair toss* even though it’s super super easy? It’s comforting without being heavy, nutritious without being boring, and beautiful without being high maintenance. \n\n I came into this realization too late to include it in the photos here, but serving this with a little side of pickled cucumber salad (sliced cucumbers, sliced red onion, white vinegar, olive oil, salt, and sugar) is *chef’s kiss* SOS perfection.\n\n With or without the cucumber salad, I can definitely say that swooping the wooden spoon leisurely through that luscious sauce, piling the saucy goodness of chickpeas and spinach over steaming rice, and then drizzling the chili crisp (affiliate link) over the whole thing… it’s definitely a living-my-best-life type moment."

(And by could, I mean I currently am.) \n\n We were actually planning to publish this later in the SOS Series, but I could not wait to get this into your hands because I’m so obsessed with it. So here she is, making an early entrance! This salad is so perfect for these early days of spring / summer when it’s starting to warm up and the grass is turning green again and the body is just feeling aggressively ready for salads. \n\n So many of these salad ingredients are easy to buy pre-made / pre-ready to eat (I get a lot of them at Trader Joe’s):  "

It is my perfect food combination: something creamy, something crunchy, something tangy, and something drippy and messy to really make you feel alive. \n\n I have eaten (slash, continue to eat) these for ANY meal of the day, which is another reason why I love them. They are breakfast, brunch, lunch, and dinner all in one cute, crunchy little package. \n\n I hope you love these as much as I do – and if you do, these cauliflower tostadas with queso are your next stop!

My family is truly in love with this recipe.\n\n These butter chicken meatballs are covered in a rich and mildly spiced tomato gravy that is made luxurious with just a little bit of butter and cream. It is a thing of beauty. I look forward to dinner all day long when I know we are having this. And as I’m sure you imagine, the leftovers are even better, so lunch the next day is something to look forward to, too.\n\n You can make it on the stovetop or in the Instant Pot, and you can use a regular or immersion blender to get your sauce nice and creamy. I often have a batch of baked chicken meatballs on hand so I like to use those, but this would be delicious and easy with some store-bought meatballs to really lock in the SOS goodness here "

Best. Of. Both. Worlds. \n\n My second favorite thing about these cookies is that they also just shine, and I mean really shine, with rich, deep, caramelly flavor thanks to a whole lot of browned butter. "

I love, love, love these crispy pan-fried little guys. \n\n And as if the salmon burgers weren’t good enough already to eat on their own (which, um, they are), I need you to make this slaw to serve your salmon burgers in/on/around. It is nothing fancy – just a shredded cabbage, yogurt, herbs, garlic, and vinegar situation, but paired with the salmon burgers? The crispy-salty-tangy combo is an ON-POINT combo. "
