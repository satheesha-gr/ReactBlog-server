I totally get that.”) \n\n You respect your client’s autonomy, and interact with them as an equal partner. \n\n You often say, “What would you like to do next? I have some ideas, but I’d love to hear what you’re thinking first.” \n\n  As a result, even when they’re in foreign territory, clients end up feeling supported, but also free. "

For those who depend on insulin, the CGM device can help their doctor modify the dose. \n\n It was only a matter of time until people without diabetes began exploring the potential of CGMs to help them meet their goals. \n\n An endurance athlete, for example, might want to know if continuous glucose monitors could help them maintain steady fuel levels.

Your new self (the one who runs!) begins January 1.\n\n Because your brain distinguishes between these two selves, it’s much easier to believe that your “new self” will succeed.\n\n That might sound silly: After all, you won’t actually magically transform the moment the ball drops on New Year’s Eve or a new calendar day dawns.\n\n  But human psychology is a funny thing, and this separation of self enables us to release ourselves from our past “failures,” and believe that a different way forward is possible.\n\n That belief is critical for behavior change.\n\n “When we believe we can get better at something, we develop self-efficacy,” says Dr. Nordin. “Self-efficacy leads to increased motivation, enabling us to tackle the challenges in front of us, which ultimately leads to behavior change.” "
