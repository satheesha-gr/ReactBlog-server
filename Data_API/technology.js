      description: "I attended a race earlier this year where the winning car went 180 mph with nobody behind the wheel. That's because everything was in the hands of artificial intelligence. \n\n At the Indy Autonomous Challenge, teams from around the world crafted their very own AI driving systems and raced them head to head for the chance to win a $1 million cash prize. The event was held at the Las Vegas Motor Speedway shortly after CES in January. \n\n Big name brands from the automotive and computing world donated hardware to ensure every team was using the same basic vehicle and computing stack so that it really all came down to the AI. \n\n We spoke to representatives from various teams to learn about the challenges of building AI drivers to operate at such high speeds, what to do when you have a crash shortly before race day, and what gives their AI an edge over the competition. \n\n  In the end, only one team could take home the prize. In doing so, it set a world record for fastest autonomous driving on a racetrack. ",

That should mean it'll be a far more affordable headset than what Apple is readying. "

      description: "With cybercrime rates on the rise, it's more important than ever to protect yourself online. You should always exercise caution when opening links and visiting unvetted websites, but for true security, you'll want to use a VPN, or virtual private network. A VPN creates an encrypted connection between your devices and the internet, which allows you to browse securely and keep your sensitive data away from prying eyes. We've tested out and rounded up some of the the best VPNs available in 2023, and now we've short-listed some of the best offers you can get right now to help you sign up with a VPN service at a low price. \n\n There are many good reasons to use a virtual private network. For example, did you know your internet service provider amasses as much data as possible on your digital activity? A 2021 Federal Trade Commission report noted that the leading ISPs have gathered user data on topics as personal as race, sexual orientation and real-time location. They've combined it, cross-referenced it and shared it with third-party partners. Yikes."

      description: "The Pixel 8 didn't make an appearance at Google's I/O conference, but the company did launch the Pixel 7A -- its budget-minded alternative to the Pixel 7. That's a win for Pixel fans, since the 7A offers many of the same benefits as the Pixel 7 -- including a great camera and the new Tensor G2 processor -- for $100 less. \n\n  But it also makes me wonder whether Google's A-series phones are beginning to overshadow its flagship Pixels. \n\n   Now that Google has narrowed the gap between the Pixel 7 and 7A, it should think more carefully about its target audience for the Pixel 8. If the Pixel 7A is for those who want a basic Pixel experience without compromising on performance and camera quality, and the Pixel 7 Pro is for photography enthusiasts, then who's the Pixel 7 for? That's the question I'm hoping Google answers with the Pixel 8, along with some other routine improvements to software support and battery life.  \n\n  Google typically releases new Pixel phones in the fall, so we're expecting to learn more about the Pixel 8 in a few months.

      description: "A small keyboard and trackpad lies in my lap. But there's no screen. Not that you can see, anyway. To me, I have a curved wraparound workspace with dozens of windows open. I'm seeing it on a pair of AR glasses (with prescription inserts) perched on my nose. \n\n I first tried the Spacetop in Las Vegas back in January, but the company that developed it, Sightful, is finally announcing the early-access product experiment now. I've seen tons of AR and VR headsets, but very few unique peripherals designed to work together with these future goggles and glasses. Instead of gaming or social experiences, Spacetop's main pitch is to turn laptops into AR-assisted devices with endless virtual displays. \n\n If that sounds like a weird pitch, consider that I've already lived it. I've paired Meta's Quest Pro to my laptop to extend its virtual monitors around my head, and plenty of solutions like this already exist using available apps. The interfaces can be clunky, and the hardware isn't totally made to be mobile. Spacetop's keyboard base, with its own Qualcomm processor inside, acts as a spatially tracked anchor that the AR glasses can follow and track the floating displays to. The tracking can work while in motion in a car or plane, and a button on the keyboard can make the floating displays vanish for an in-room conversation with someone, toggling the virtual screens on and off.

After getting her first pair of hearing aids, Christine found the noises profound.\n\n 'It was surprising to stop and hear what things actually sound like to other people,' she said. 'I sat down beside a construction site just to hear the different noises. I like to listen to the machines running. My favorite is the 18-wheelers driving around the site'. \n\n  'The rumble sounds better than before.'\n\n  Christine struggled to hear out of her left ear for her whole life. In March, she was prescribed her first pair of hearing aids. In addition to dramatically improving her hearing, they also notably improved her balance. \n\n Christine is one of the 38 million Americans who have some degree of hearing loss. Hers was genetic, but many more are put at risk by exposure to loud noises. The World Health Organization estimates that over a billion young adults are at risk of hearing loss 'due to unsafe listening practices.' "

Rival Google followed with AI Bard in March. The waitlist to try Bard has now been removed, with the service publicly available as of this week. \n\n Chinese giant Alibaba also unveiled a ChatGPT rival, with both Chinese and English capabilities, while Tesla and Twitter CEO Elon Musk has created an artificial intelligence company called X.AI. \n\n CNET has broken down the performance of ChatGPT, Bing and Google Bard to work out which AI chatbot is the most helpful.

      Overview:"At Google I/O, the company unveiled an experimental version of Search that integrates AI-generated responses. Will it break the balance of the internet?.",
      description: "The future of Google Search is a big green box. \n\n That's exactly what Google showed off this month at Google I/O, the company's yearly developer conference. The theme for 2023 was AI, a term mentioned more than 140 times during the two-hour keynote presentation. Google unveiled AI products that will actually be released to the public, an about-face for the apprehensive internet giant in response to growing competition. \n\n  Late last year, OpenAI launched ChatGPT to near-universal adulation. Suddenly, everybody had access to a generative AI engine that could seemingly answer any question with a novel response. It's powered by a large language model, or LLM, that essentially lets it act as 'autocomplete on steroids,' using massive amounts of text data to figure out what the next best word should be.  \n\n  The power and ease of ChatGPT helped it become the fastest growing consumer web platform ever. It prompted Microsoft to up its investment into OpenAI and integrate ChatGPT's tech directly into Bing search earlier this year, a move that helped the company see a 16% increase in traffic. The day before Microsoft unveiled Bing AI, Google announced its own generative AI engine, Bard, although it flubbed the launch and lost $100 billion in stock market value in the process. The stock has since rebounded to its highest level so far this year. \n\n  In many ways, Google I/O was a referendum on the company's wonky entrance into consumer AI and a clear message to skeptics (and investors) that it's willing to take radical steps to stay at the forefront of internet search, even if that means upending its core product. Google Search has long been the engine for how we all look for product information, find the latest news and otherwise interact with the internet, and for how many businesses make money. "
