        title:'Shazam! Fury of the Gods',
        Overview: 'Billy Batson and his foster siblings, who transform into superheroes by saying "Shazam!", are forced to get back into action and fight the Daughters of Atlas, who they must stop from using a weapon that could destroy the world.',
        description: "Shazam! Fury of the Gods is a run-of-the mill superhero sequel that doesn’t progress the genre forward, but delivers two hours of pure entertainment. \n\n This film does not do any one thing great, but it was still a pretty decent watch. The plot is average—nothing we have not seen on the big screen before. Our villains have no development; their motivations are sound, but there is nothing further that develops them into something greater. \n\n This movie starts off incredibly strong, with a fantastic first act that had me laughing hysterically. The comedy hits more often than not, which was a surprise for me. There is a bridge rescue scene that is electric. The combination of I Need a Hero mixed with all of the heroes showcasing their abilities was amazing. I think superhero films have dropped the ball by not showing heroes rescuing everyday people. The stakes have gotten so high outside of the everyday troubles that this art is lost. I really enjoyed that aspect of the film, but unfortunately, after the first act, this story becomes inflated to a point where it is indistinguishable from many other superhero blockbusters.\n\n The final act is overly long and bloated with a plethora of CGI monsters for our heroes to defeat. I think the CGI actually looked pretty good, but it just was not an engaging conclusion for me. The stakes were high, but not built up properly for me to be genuinely interested. The action is pretty decent, but I couldn’t care less. The finale did have emotional beats in terms of the family connection, which worked surprisingly well. That is when this franchise works best. When the focus is on family and not on god's attempts to destroy Earth, \n\n The performances overall were pretty good. Zachary Levi is fantastic as Shazam; he has mastered the art of playing a child in a man's body. Jack Dylan Grazer is hilarious; his comedic timing is brilliant. Grace Caroline Currey is a queen. Rachel Zegler is a standout, and her chemistry with Grazer is top notch. The rest of the Shazamly do a great job as well. I think Helen Mirren and Lucy Liu are fine as antagonists but were wasted with a lack of screen time and development. \n\n Overall, this might not be good, but it is entertaining. That is a lot more than can be said for some of the recently released superhero films (Black Adam and Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania). "

      Overview: 'Salt-of-the-earth Cole falls head over heels for enigmatic Sadie — but then makes the shocking discovery that she’s a secret agent. Before they can decide on a second date, Cole and Sadie are swept away on an international adventure to save the world.',
      description: "The direction and visuals were all fairly good. The visuals looked fine for the majority of the film with no complaints whatsoever, including Ana de Armas’ wig. The direction was good, with some decent action choreography that was filmed pretty well, although there were a few scenes that suffered from too many jump cuts. I thought the intimate scene towards the beginning of the film was very stylistic and done really well. It was not just your standard grunts and moans that you see in so many films today.\n\nThe story was very oddly paced. The beginning section was really rushed, and the romantic build-up did not feel genuine in the slightest. Due to a poor script, their chemistry was non-existent in some sections, as the dialogue was atrocious. While there are some laughs to be had for sure, the majority of the comedy did not work for me. There was heavy use of modern songs throughout the entirety of the film. While some sections were complimented by the tracks, many others felt really out of place.\n\nThe performances were decent, but I think were hindered by the poor script. Ana de Armas was fine, although I never really liked her in anything since Knives Out as her performances always seem a little dull. Chris Evans played a character he's played many times before, which was entertaining, but he could not alone save the terrible dialogue he was given. "

        title:'Creed III',
        Overview: 'After dominating the boxing world, Adonis Creed has been thriving in both his career and family life. When a childhood friend and former boxing prodigy, Damian Anderson, resurfaces after serving a long sentence in prison, he is eager to prove that he deserves his shot in the ring. ',
        description: "This reminded me quite a lot of 'Rocky IV' (1985) only instead of a Russian auto-box doing the challenging, it's 'Damian' (Jonathan Majors). Former champion 'Adonis' (Michael B. Jordan) is living the life of a retired sportsman, wealthy and happy with his family whilst managing the gym with 'Duke' (Wood Harris). Leaving, one afternoon, he discovers a guy sitting on his car and after a quick chat realizes that it's his long-lost childhood pal who has been incarcerated for the last eighteen years. He ('Damian') is now determined to succeed in the ring and so his friend tries to sort it all out - only to discover that this lean, mean, fighting machine has an altogether different agenda and that is going to force the former champ to prove whether or not he still has what it takes. The story is a hybrid of too many others and plays out as predictably as the sun coming up. Add to the mix a degree of familial discord and melodrama and we are left with something largely forgettable that I found to be a pretty poor relation of the previous, much more charismatic and grittier efforts in this franchise. The actual boxing scenes are impressively photographed but there's just no jeopardy - and I'd largely given up. Pretty to look at, yes - but not a great watch."

        Overview: 'Peter Quill, still reeling from the loss of Gamora, must rally his team around him to defend the universe along with protecting one of their own. A mission that, if not completed successfully, could quite possibly lead to the end of the Guardians as we know them.',
        description: "Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 is the perfect farewell to this quirky group of rogues we never expected to love so much.\n\nOur faith in the Marvel Cinematic Universe waned throughout Phase 4 with films that felt hollow, rushed, and insincere. Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 rekindled my hope as James Gunn and the cast’s love and passion for these characters shined in every moment of this beautiful, heartfelt send-off. Gunn reminded us of the magic of comic book movies when the storyteller cares more about the characters than the box office. Chris Pratt, Bradley Cooper, Karen Gillan, Dave Bautista, and the rest of the cast pour themselves into entertaining and genuine performances. This film is surprisingly emotional and had me wondering how they convinced me to care so deeply about such a zany group of goofballs, but that they did. Vol. 3 is one of the best conclusions to a film trilogy that had me leave the theater full of satisfaction and nostalgia. While Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 is wonderful in nearly every way, if I had a complaint, it would be the soundtrack felt forced at times rather than complimenting strong moments in the first film. The villain wasn’t exceptional but was better than the average Marvel villain, and honestly, Vol. 3 wasn’t about the villain or battles as much as it was a farewell to a family of heroes we have all come to love. This movie is well worth your time, and the fantastic effects and cinematography warrant a trip to the cinema to enjoy it to its fullest! MCU doubters need to set aside their skepticism and enjoy saying goodbye to these beloved characters with this outstanding film."

          description: "John Wick 4 is an absolute masterpiece of an action film. From start to finish, this movie delivers an adrenaline-fueled experience that will leave you breathless. The action is intense, with each fight scene being expertly choreographed and executed. The action set pieces are some of the most memorable I've ever seen, with each one being more jaw-dropping than the last.\n\nOne of the standout aspects of John Wick 4 is the villains. This time around, they are more interesting than ever, with big-name actors bringing their A-game to their respective roles. It's always great to see veteran actors like Keanu Reeves and Laurence Fishburne on screen, but the addition of newcomers like Bill Skarsgard and Donnie Yen really elevates the movie.\n\nBut perhaps the real star of John Wick 4 is the fight cinematography. The one-take fight scene that was filmed from overhead is a work of art. It's so seamless and fluid that you feel like you're right there in the middle of the action. The attention to detail in every fight scene is astounding, with each punch and kick feeling like it has real weight behind it.\n\nOne slight negative of the movie is that John Wick doesn't have much development. However, this is a minor quibble, as the movie is so focused on delivering incredible action that the lack of character development doesn't really matter. After all, John Wick is at his best when he's kicking ass, and he certainly does that in spades in this movie.\n\nOverall, John Wick 4 is a fantastic entry in the series. The sense of finality that permeates throughout the movie is perfect, and it really feels like a fitting end to the story. If you're a fan of action movies, then John Wick 4 is an absolute must-see. It's a thrilling ride that will leave you on the edge of your seat from start to finish."

      title:"Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania", 
      description: " I had a terrific time watching 'Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania', despite hearing 'meh' things about it here and there online. It surpassed my expectations, to be honest. Great cast, entertaining action, super interesting world building (my favourite from the MCU for a while, in that regard) and the humour is good.\n\nStar of the show in my opinion is Michelle Pfeiffer. I don't recall her standing out in 'Ant-Man and the Wasp', but here she's excellent from beginning to end. Elsewhere, Jonathan Majors is brilliant - great to see that guy all over the place recently. Paul Rudd remains a strong lead, while the likes of Michael Douglas and Kathryn Newton are positives too.\n\nLove the Quantum Realm setting. I'm nothing like an MCU nut, I'm only aware of the films, so didn't know what to expect, but the place looks fantastic - from the environment to the creatures; shoutout Veb. Like Pfeiffer, Corey Stoll didn't really register on my radar in prior films, but him as M.O.D.O.K. is a lot of fun.\n\nLooking at my personal MCU ranking, this goes in at no. 8 - I didn't anticipate that! A literal quick glance at the average rating on here suggests I'm in the minority but I truly found much enjoyment from this. Quite the improvement on Ant-Man 2, which is at the bottom of my aforementioned ranking."

        description: "This is certainly a triumph for the visual and audio effects folks. Otherwise, I found it all a bit derivative and frankly a rather classless rehash of the much more entertaining original. It's tough to just keep on re-inventing these themes - they do tire, and as I reckon with the recent updates of the Halloween franchise, they maybe just rely too heavily on a current generation who were not around to see the originals in the cinema first time round, and who maybe just don't appreciate that the acting and the writing - though never exactly crucial to these plots - did have more of a role than just relying on well made-up (virtual) demons spinning around the ceiling emitting threatening shrieks. It's not terrible - it moves along quickly for ninety minutes and might just put you off a bath anytime shortly afterwards, but there just isn't any real sense of menace or jeopardy and to be honest I wasn't entirely sure that the family weren't nightmarish enough - before their visitor arrived.

        Overview: 'During the war in Afghanistan, a local interpreter risks his own life to carry an injured sergeant across miles of grueling terrain.',
        description: "Director Guy Ritchie is no stranger to crafting exciting action films, but his latest project is quite different than his previous work. The narrative is linear, there aren’t any montages, and the story isn’t about criminals, gangsters, or Brits. Fans of Ritchie will absolutely still recognize his visual style (hello, overhead shots) and testosterone-fueled themes, but 'The Covenant' is a more dramatic, mature, and restrained work from the legendary director.\n\nSet during the war in Afghanistan in 2018, the film tells the story of U.S. Army sergeant John Kinley (Jake Gyllenhaal) and his local Afghan interpreter, Ahmed (Dar Salim). Called a traitor by his people for helping the Americans, Ahmed has volunteered to seek revenge against the Taliban that killed his son. He has also been promised visas for his service so his family can flee to safety in America. After a lethal ambush in the desert, Kinley is gravely injured by enemy fire. With his platoon gone, Ahmed refuses to leave a fellow soldier behind to die, so he drags Kinley through the mountainous terrain in order to get him back to the base for medical help.\n\nThe film tells the story of their 100 mile journey, but then pivots to Kinley’s return to the United States. It’s months after he gets home that Kinley learns Ahmed and his family were not given safe passage as promised and, as a way to repay the debt he owes his friend, he returns to Afghanistan to retrieve them. It won’t be easy, because Ahmed has been placed at the top of the Taliban’s most wanted hit list.\n\nIt’s a meaningful story of honor and brotherhood wrapped up in an intense wartime thriller. The story is told in three major acts, from the early days Ahmed and Kinley spent chasing IEDs, to their dangerous journey, to the red tape of getting a man what he’s owed. There are plenty of thrilling acting sequences throughout, and they will keep you on the edge of your seat.\n\nRitchie has an extraordinary sense of timing and instincts for shooting action scenes, and the brutal, graphic wartime violence puts you in the be-or-be-killed survival mind of a front line soldier."

        description: " Seven Kings Must Die is the conclusion of The Last Kingdom series. A conclusion that didn't feel necessary as the story ended with a satisfying resolution and characters we had grown to love over five seasons finding happiness and a rewarding future. Instead, this 2-hour movie is more of a finale that disrupts our story's happy ending and leaves it all with less closure than before. With the promise of a movie, I was hoping that the film would enjoy greater production quality and resources than the typical show, but that was not the case. Seven Kings Must Die was just an entire season of The Last Kingdom crammed into 2 hours. Fans of the series might enjoy seeing more of their favorite characters (although they might be disappointed with the conclusion of those characters' stories). Unfortunately, those unfamiliar with The Last Kingdom would be confused by the partial narrative they receive with this film. Seven King Must Die might have been a decent finale to an additional season of the show, but as someone who liked how the show ended, I wish I had joined my wife and gone to bed without finishing the film. The show is excellent, so watch that instead. It really isn't as bad as I am sharing, but I was happier as a fan without it, and non-fans would probably not find it worth their time, either."

The villain is evil sure, but also extremely stupid and escaping from her first attempt to kill him in a very unbelievable and unexplained way.\n\nThe romantic tension between Cruise and the mother also doesn't work and the age old friendship with Jons is also not given any backstory. I'm enclined to blame the casting here. Well, the story was lacking and oddly edited as well, but it may be because there wasn't much to work with. Either way, it's clear this is supposed to be about a mother/daughter relationship, but also be an action move and the director / writers / actors couldn't make it work. 3/10, 2 points cause I've seen worse, not because I can find something positive in it.
